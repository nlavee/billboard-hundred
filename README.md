**Description**  
A side-project that aims to look at the billboard hot-100 chart from 1960s till 2015s at the last possible day of the year.  
Each song's lyrics will be analyzed for the number of distinctive words.  
The initial aim of the project is to look at whether the number of distinctive words has changed over time. I consider this might provide a good indicator of creativity shown by the artists in different generations.
